<H1>A Guide to Data Visualizations at BLS</H1>
<P>Data visualizations display  quantitative information visually.
 Visualizations include charts, maps,  infographics, and other types of
displays.  Readers often understand statistics  more easily and quickly
when
they are  presented visually.</P>
<P>Good data visualizations achieve the following objectives:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Present complex data simply</LI>
  <LI>Work well with general and expert  audiences</LI>
  <LI>Help readers see important points  quickly</LI>
  <LI>Help us communicate more effectively  than we can with pages of
text and
  detailed tables</LI>
  <LI>Stimulate curiosity</LI></UL>
<P>Most BLS publications use data visualizations, and you can find
plenty of
 good examples in each of them.</p><p>    There are many different types of
data
 visualizations, and new  ones are created all the time. There are also
many
good  guides you can find  through a web search about which data
visualizations
are  best for particular  types of data. This guide isn't intended to
be
exhaustive,  but here are brief  explanations and examples of the most
common
data  visualizations we use at BLS.</P>

<H2 id="line-charts">Line Charts</H2>
<P>Line charts are used to  show data relative to a continuous variable,
usually
 time. We use line charts  at BLS to show historical series or
projections. Line
 charts make it easy for  the reader to identify trends.</P>
<P align="center"><IMG width="746" height="605" alt="Line Chart"
src="images/line-charts.png"></P=
>
<H2 id="two-scale-charts">Two-scale Charts</H2>
<P>A two-scale line chart or  combination line-column chart allows you
to plot
 data using two y-axes and a  shared x-axis. These charts are often used
to show
 a correlation=97or lack of correlation=97between  data sets that have
different
 units of measurement. Be careful when using  two-scale charts because
readers
 may find it difficult to determine which  dataset corresponds with each
y-axis.
 Two-scale charts that have different  y-axes also can be misleading if
the
 scales are manipulated in a way to make it  appear data series are
correlated
 when they really are not.</P>
<P align="center"><IMG width="604" height="373" alt="Two-scale
Chart"
src="images/two-scale-chart.png"=
></P>
<H2 id="area-charts">Area Charts</H2>
<P>An area chart is similar to  a line chart, but the space between the
x-axis
 and the line is filled with a  color or pattern. It is useful for
showing
 part-to-whole relationships, such as  the number of unemployed people
by reason
 for unemployment. Area charts help  you analyze both overall and
individual
 trends.</P>
<P align="center"><IMG width="734" height="609" alt="Area Chart"
src="images/area-charts.png"></P=
>
<H2 id="column-charts">Column charts (also called vertical bar
charts)</H2>
<P>Column charts are best for comparing data grouped by discrete
categories.
 Column charts are best when you don't have too many groups (fewer
than 8 is
 usually good).</P>
<P align="center"><IMG width="790" height="650" alt="Column
Chart"
src="images/column-charts.png"><=
/P>
<H2 id="stacked-column-charts">Stacked column charts (also called
stacked
 vertical bar charts)</H2>
<P>Stacked column charts are a  great choice if you not only want to
show the
 size of a group relative to other  groups, but also illustrate the
parts that
 make up the whole group.</P>
<P align="center"><IMG width="722" height="638" alt="Stacked
column chart"
src="images/stacked-column-chart.png"></P>
<H2 id="horizontal-bar-charts">Horizontal bar charts</H2>
<P>A horizontal bar chart is  similar to a vertical bar chart but is
typically
 used when the number of  categories is large (greater than 8 or so) or
you have
 long labels that you  would like to display for each category. It's
much easier
 to read the labels  when they are displayed in proper orientation.</P>
<P align="center"><IMG width="809" height="705" alt="Horizontal
bar chart"
src="images/horizontal-bar-chart.png"></P>
<H2 id="scatter-plots">Scatter plots</H2>
<P>A scatter plot chart shows  the relationship between two different
variables.
 If the data points form a  band extending from lower left to upper
right, there
 is probably a positive  correlation between the two variables. If the
band runs
 from upper left to  lower right, a negative correlation is probable. If
it is
 hard to see a  pattern, there is probably no correlation.</P>
<P align="center"><IMG width="692" height="672" alt="Scatter
plot"
src="images/scatter-plot.png"></=
P>
<H2 id="bubble-charts">Bubble charts</H2>
<P>A bubble chart is similar  to a scatter plot, but the size of the
bubble
 represents a third variable.</P>
<P align="center"><IMG width="731" height="739" alt="Bubble
chart"
src="images/bubble-chart.png"></=
P>
<H2 id="pie-charts">Pie charts</H2>
<P>Pie charts are easy to read,  and nearly all readers understand them,
so that
 makes them an appealing choice to  show readers the parts of a whole.
One
 disadvantage of pie charts is that they  have no scale to make it easy
for
 readers to determine values the way they can  from the vertical axis on
a
column  chart or line chart. Nevertheless, pie  charts can be useful for
showing
 approximate values. If you have more than four  or five categories,
it's usually  better not to use a pie chart; a column or bar  chart may be
more
appropriate.  It's a good practice to order the pieces of the  pie
according to
size and  always make sure the total of all the pieces adds up  to 100
percent.</P>
<P align="center"><IMG width="722" height="531" alt="Pie Chart"
src="images/pie-chart.png"></P>
<H2 id="maps">Maps</H2>
<P>Maps show geographic  relationships or variation in data. At BLS we
commonly
 use maps to show data  for states, metro areas, and counties.</P>
<P align="center"><IMG width="888" height="739" alt="Map of the
U.S. with shaded states"

<H2 id="chart-making-tools">Chart-making tools</H2>
<P>There are many good software tools for creating data  visualizations.
This
 guide does not focus on how to use any specific software  but instead
presents
 good practices for making effective visualizations.</P>
<P>These guidelines apply to static, interactive,  or animated data
 visualizations. In some places, we discuss how interactivity  or
animation can
 improve a data visualization. </P>
<H2 id="keys-for-effective-data-visualizations">Keys for effective
data
 visualizations</H2>
<P><STRONG>Know your audience.</STRONG> Simpler data visualizations are
usually
 better for any audience,  but an expert audience may understand more
complex
 visualizations. As with any  type of communication, know your
audience.<BR>
<P><STRONG>Make data visualizations a central  feature of your
storytelling.
</STRONG>You may  find it helpful to create your data visualizations
<EM>before</EM> you begin writing, to help you see the interesting data

 patterns you want to write about.</P>
<P><STRONG>Choose the right data visualization  to help you tell your
 story.</STRONG> Would  a map explain a point more clearly than a chart?
Would a
 stacked column chart  be better than a pie chart? Not sure how to
choose? The
 staff in the <A href="mailto:newmedia@bls.gov">Office of
Publications</A> can
 help.</P>
<P><STRONG>A data visualization must be able to stand alone.</STRONG>
Data
 visualizations often complement the text,  but a visualization also
must be
 understandable apart from the text that  accompanies it.</P>
<H2
id="guidelines-for-specific-parts-of-data-visualizations">Guidelines
for
 specific parts of data visualizations</H2>
<H3 id="chart-and-map-titles">Chart and Map Titles</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>Each graphic should have a title that briefly describes the data
in the
  chart or map.</LI>
  <LI>The title should be at the top of the graphic and no more than two
 lines
   long.</LI>
  <LI>Graphics may have titles that are purely descriptive, or they may
present
    analytical results. Compare these two examples:</LI>
  <UL>
    <LI>Descriptive title: "Selected percentiles of usual weekly
earnings  of
     full-time wage and salary workers age 16 and older, in 2017
dollars,
    1979"</LI>
    <LI>Analytical title: "Real earnings increased for the highest
earners
    since 1979 but are unchanged for the lowest
earners"</LI></UL></UL>
<P>Most BLS publications use descriptive titles, but there is nothing
wrong
 with using analytical titles. As always, the choice about which style
to  use
 depends on the audience. The editors in the Office of Publications can
help
you  decide. The BLS publication <A
href="https://www.bls.gov/spotlight/archive.htm"
target="_blank">Spotlight on Statistics</A> uses both styles together.
The chart
 titles typically use the  descriptive style, but each slide in
Spotlight also
 includes a headline that is  analytical.</P>
<H3 id="legends">Legends</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>Legends should appear in the same order and direction as the data.
 This
  arrangement sometimes is not possible for line charts in which the
lines
  cross one another. The arrangement is helpful for bar and column
charts and
  line charts in which the lines do not cross. See the examples
below.</LI>
  <P align="center"><IMG width="749" height="766" alt="Example

  <P align="center"><IMG width="749" height="641" alt="Example
of line chart with legend"

src="images/legends-line-chart.png"></P></UL>
<H3 id="gridlines">Gridlines</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>Use gridlines to help guide  the reader's eye, but don't make
them too
  intrusive. You want readers to focus  on the data, not the
gridlines.</LI>
  <P align="center"><IMG width="733" height="554" alt="Example
of line chart with gridlines"

src="images/gridlines.png"></P><=
/UL>
<H3 id="notes-and-sources">Notes and Sources</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>Notes, located at the bottom of the  chart, should be brief and
should
  provide information to help the reader  understand how the interactive

  features work or what recession shading or  similar features
mean.</LI>
  <LI>Avoid including detailed technical  explanations about the data in
a
  chart. Such explanations often distract  readers from the main point
of the
  chart. Find another place in the publication  to explain technical
  information.</LI>
  <LI>A typical note on a BLS chart might  say, "Shaded areas represent

  recessions as determined by the National  Bureau of Economic Research.
Click
  legend items to change data display. Hover  over chart to view
data."</LI>
  <LI>All data visualizations should include a source  note that credits
the
  data to BLS or another source. The source note is the  last item in
the
  graphic. If the visualization shows BLS data, always show  "Source:
U.S.
  Bureau of Labor Statistics." Avoid citing the specific BLS  program,
however,
   because doing so clutters the visualization and does not  provide
information
    that is meaningful to most readers.</LI></UL>
<H3 id="axis-titles">Axis Titles</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>Axis titles may not be  necessary if the chart title is clear
about the
  unit of measurement. Axis  titles also may not be necessary if other

  information makes it clear the axis  shows dollar amounts,
percentages, dates,
    and so forth. If an axis title is  needed, be brief. In the chart
below,
  there   are no axis titles. The % next to  the numbers in the
vertical axis
  labels   eliminate the need for an axis title  that says
Percent. On the
  horizontal   axis, the labels clearly show years, so  an axis title is
not
  needed.</LI>
  <P align="center"><IMG width="737" height="704" alt="Example
of line chart with axis titles"

src="images/axis-titles.png"></P=
>
  <LI>The title for the vertical axis should  be at the top of the axis
and
  should always be centered and appear horizontally  over the axis.</LI>
  <LI>The title for the horizontal axis is  centered horizontally under
the
  axis.</LI>
  <LI>Scatter plots and bubble charts  nearly always need to have axis
titles to
    make it clear which measure appears  on each axis.</LI></UL>
<H3 id="time-periods">Time Periods</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>Charts and maps should always be  clear about the time period
covered by
  the data. In line charts that show time  series, the time period
usually is
  clear from looking at the horizontal axis.  In that case, the chart
title
  doesn't also need to state the time period.</LI>
  <LI>The horizontal axis doesn't need a label  at every month,
quarter, or
  year. The axis should have labels the beginning and  ending period,
but not
  necessarily everything in between. Readers can figure  out the label
patterns
   pretty easily, such as every 12 months, 5 years, and so  forth.
Labeling only
    some periods between the beginning and the end reduces clutter  and
makes it
    easier for readers to focus on more important points of the data
story.</LI>
  <LI>Even if the chart shows monthly data,  it is acceptable for the
horizontal
    axis labels to show only years. The <A
href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2017/real-average-hourly-earnings-in=
creased-0-point-2-percent-from-november-2016-to-november-2017.htm"
  target="_blank">tooltips  in interactive graphics</A> make  the
specific month
    clear.</LI>
  <LI>Maps, bar and column charts, bubble charts,  scatter plots, and
most other
    types of charts other than line charts typically  need to state the
time
  period in the title.</LI></UL>
<H3 id="scale">Scale</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>Most charts have a scale that begins  at zero, but sometimes it is
better
   to zoom in on a limited range of data.</LI>
  <UL>
    <LI>Line charts do not necessarily have to start at zero.  It all
depends on
        the range of the values. For  example, the civilian labor force

    participation rate has drifted downward since  reaching a peak in
the late
      1990s and early 2000s. A <A
href="https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-labor-fo=
rce-participation-rate.htm"
    target="_blank">chart  showing the range of values from 62 percent
to 68
    percent</A> shows the decline clearly. If  the chart scale went from
zero to
        100 percent, the line would be flatter. That hides  the
variation and
    the     interesting story and arguably misleads readers. </LI>
    <LI>For bar and column charts, the scale must
<STRONG>always</STRONG> start
       at zero because the  relative size of the bars is important for
scaling.
       Starting at anything other  than zero distorts the scaling. For
example,
    see     the charts below showing  employment in the fictional
occupation
    drone     dispatchers. If there were 100  drone dispatchers employed
in year
    1 and 110     employed in year 2, the increase  would be 10 percent.
If the
    scale of a     column chart began at 90 instead of  zero, that would
make
    the year 2 column     (90 to 110) twice as tall as the year 1
column (90 to
    100). That would     mislead readers into thinking the increase was
100
    percent instead of 10     percent.</LI>
    <P align="center"><IMG width="638" height="471" alt="Example

src="images/appropriate-scale.png"></P>
    <P align="center"><IMG width="636" height="467" alt="Example
of bar chart with misleading scale"

src="images/misleading-scale.png"></P>
    <LI>Most interactive graphics have a scale that adjusts
automatically
    depending on the data values. For bar and column charts, the  scale
always
      begins at zero, and the maximum depends on the highest value. For
line
     charts and other charts, the minimum and maximum vary with the data
values
        shown. </LI>
    <LI>If you have a series of similar graphics in a publication, it is

    probably  best for each graphic to use the same scaling.</LI>
    <LI>A short <A
href="https://qz.com/418083/its-ok-not-to-start-your-y-axis-at-zero/"

    scaling.</LI></UL></UL>
<H3 id="tooltips-for-interactive-graphics">Tooltips for interactive
 graphics</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>Interactive graphics  include tooltips=97pop-up text boxes that
show data
  values when the reader hovers  over the appropriate area of the chart.

  Tooltips can enhance data  visualizations by providing readers with
quick
  access to information about  specific data points. The software BLS
uses to
  create interactive graphics  automatically creates the tooltips based
on data
   displayed in the chart.</LI>
  <P align="center"><IMG width="725" height="660" alt="Example
of horizontal bar chart with interactive graphics"

src="images/interactive-graphics.png"></P>
  <UL>
    <LI>As  with other aspects of data visualizations, tooltips should
be
    concise.</LI>
    <LI>Tooltips  can display extra information not shown in the data

    visualization, but that  extra information should relate directly to
the
    data displayed in the  visualization. For example, a map that shows
the
    percent change in employment  in each state over the year might have
a
    tooltip that shows the percent change,  the change in the employment
level,
       the most recent employment level, and the  employment level a
year
    earlier.</LI>
    <P align="center"><IMG width="917" height="807" alt="Example
of map with extra information in tooltip"

src="images/interactive-graphics-tooltip.png"></P>
    <LI>Tooltips  generally should not include extra data that are not
used to
      derive the  measures shown in the data visualization. For example,
a chart
        showing  employment changes in large counties should not show
wage
    levels in     those  counties if the wage levels are not shown in
the
    chart.</LI></UL></UL>

<UL>
  <LI>You might sort data  differently in a chart than you would in a
table. For
    example, BLS tables  typically show industries based on the NAICS
hierarchy.
    If you want to show  readers which industries had the highest and
lowest job
    growth, it would be  more effective to sort the industries based on

<UL>
  <UL>
    <LI>Use colors that are easy to distinguish from one another.</LI>
    <LI>When choosing colors, be mindful of readers with color vision

    deficiency (CVD), commonly called color blindness. There are a
number of
    good  resources to help you use colors and patterns that readers
with CVD
     can see  well, including these from <A

    <LI>Consider using color in combination with texture  in logical
ways to
    help readers understand data groups. The <A
href="https://www.bls.gov/charts/job-openings-and-labor-turnover/openin=

    <P align="center"><IMG width="715" height="553" alt="Example
of line chart with color and texture" src="images/color-and-texture.png"></P>
    <LI>Use color palettes that  help readers understand logical groups.
For
    example, in a chart showing different  types of employee benefits,
you might
        group insurance benefits with one color  and use different
colors for
     retirement benefits, paid time off, and bonuses.</LI>
    <P align="center"><IMG width="778" height="741" alt="Example

    <LI>Use color palettes that  help readers understand data ranges.
For

href="https://www.bls.gov/charts/state-employment-and-unemployment/stat=
e-unemployment-rates-map.htm"
    target="_blank">map  showing unemployment rates in each state</A>
may show
      all states in blue, with lighter blue  for states with lower rates
and
    darker blue for states with higher rates.</LI>
    <LI>Don't use colors that perpetuate stereotypes, such as a blue
line
    showing men's earnings and a pink line showing women's
earnings.</LI>
    <LI> Use the same color for a series that is included  in other
charts

      brief.</LI>
    <LI>Series names in legends and labels can be challenging because of
 the
     sometimes wordy industry, occupation, and other titles we use at
BLS. We
      need to be accurate about what a series represents, but if a title
is too
        wordy, consider ways to shorten it to improve reader
understanding.
    Avoid     using  abbreviations that may shorten a title but may
confuse
    readers about     the  meaning.</LI>
    <LI>Notes should be brief and should provide  information to help
the reader
        understand how the interactive features work or  what recession
shading
    or     other features mean. It is usually best to exclude  detailed
    technical     explanations about the data in a chart.</LI></UL></UL>

id="static-versus-interactive-and-animated-data-visualizations">Static

 versus Interactive and Animated Data Visualizations</H2>
<P>Throughout our history, BLS has created static charts and maps to
present
 data visually. We still publish static data visualizations, but our
 visualizations  increasingly include interactive features.</P>
<P>Highcharts is the software we use at BLS to make interactive and
animated
 visualizations that are compatible with our web publishing platform.
The
Office  of Publications has created applications for creating
visualizations
using  Highcharts, and anyone in BLS can use them. We start with a <A
href="http://opubrev08.bls.gov/interactive-chart-maker/table_wizard/bet=
ter_table_wizard.htm"
target="_blank">table  wizard</A> in which we can easily copy data
from a
 spreadsheet to make an HTML table that is suitable for publishing. The
table
 wizard links to the <A
href="http://opubrev08.bls.gov/interactive-chart-maker/"
target="_blank">Chart Maker</A> tool, which lets us create high
quality
 interactive or animated  visualizations in minutes. The Chart Maker
tool
 provides many options for types  of data visualizations and their
features. The
 tool provides a template for  making good data visualizations and helps
us
avoid  common mistakes. Although  the tool is designed for making
interactive
and  animated visualizations, you  can also use it to make high quality
static
 visualizations.</P>
<P><STRONG>Interactive features</STRONG> provide readers with more
information
 than they can get from a static image.  For example, see an <A
href="https://www.bls.gov/charts/state-employment-and-unemployment/state-unemployment-rates-map.htm"
target="_blank">interactive  map showing state unemployment rates</A>.
When you
 hover over each state, more information pops up to show the  state's
 unemployment rate in the most recent month, the rate a year earlier,
and  the
 change over the year. When you hover over the items in the map legend,
the
 states in each category light up more brightly to help you see the
states with
 similar unemployment rates. </P>
<P>Interactive features in  charts and maps also give readers the power
to
 choose what information they  want to see. Here are some examples:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>A <A
href="https://www.bls.gov/charts/state-employment-and-unemployment/employment-by-state-bar.htm"
  target="_blank">chart  showing state employment</A> lets  readers
choose in
  the legend whether to view the employment level, the 12-month  percent
change
   in employment, or the 12-month change in the employment level.</LI>
  <LI>A <A
href="https://www.bls.gov/charts/job-openings-and-labor-turnover/opening-industry.htm"
  target="_blank">line  chart showing job openings rates by
industry</A> over
  time includes 20 different industry groups. Our brains  typically can

  interpret only 4 or 5 chart series at one time. The default view  for
this
  chart shows 4 industries and lets readers choose in the legend as many
 or as
   few industries as they want to view.</LI>
  <LI>A <A
href="https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-unemployment-rate.htm"
  target="_blank">chart  showing national unemployment rates</A> over
a 20-year
   period lets readers zoom in to see shorter time periods.</LI>
  <LI>A <A
href="https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category.htm"
  target="_blank">chart  showing the 12-month change in the Consumer
Price
  Index</A> lets readers see major categories or drill down  in a column
such as
    food to see consumer price changes for more detailed food
categories.</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Animated features</STRONG> take interactivity one step
further by
 helping readers see how  measures change over time. The map we
discussed above
 shows state unemployment  rates for a single month. An animated version
of that
 map shows how <A
href="https://www.bls.gov/charts/state-employment-and-unemployment/state-unemployment-rates-animated.htm"
target="_blank">state  unemployment rates changed each month over a
10-year
 period</A>.</P>
<P>Interactive features and animation can enhance  data visualizations,
but we
 should avoid relying only on interactivity or  animation to tell a data
story.
 All charts and maps should provide readers with  useful information as
a static
 image. Interactivity or animation complements a  good static image but
does not
 substitute for it. </P>
